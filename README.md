# basic_genome_toolkit
A simplistic framework for parsing DNA sequences, useful in DNA analysis.

Methods contained in the toolkit package include:
1. A "kmer" count, which measures the number of instances of a specific DNA sequence in a longer reference sequence.
2. A kmer frequency retriever, which returns the most common kmers in a sequence.

Instructional materials for creating this toolkit were provided from rebelScience.
